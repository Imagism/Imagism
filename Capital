Do not attack any person.

The capital of imagism is, and always has been, South Asia.
For ourselves we observe Antarctica, America (including Greenland), Norway (including Iceland, Europe, Russia, Turkiye, Assyria, and Africa), and Japan (including Asia, Australia, and Hawaii) as the regions of land on Earth.

Do not attack any person.
